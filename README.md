This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')`. This error arises when attempting to access a property of an object that's currently undefined or null, often due to asynchronous operations. The `bug.js` file shows the error in action, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using optional chaining and nullish coalescing.
